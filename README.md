# 🛍️ Ecommerce Product Listing Website

A basic and responsive Ecommerce website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to browse products from different categories (like electronics, clothing, and accessories) and displays them all on the homepage.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to provide a simple yet effective frontend for an e-commerce store. All products are dynamically loaded from a JavaScript file (`products.js`) and displayed on the homepage with product name, price, and image.

## 🎯 Features

- 📦 Display all products in a clean grid layout
- 🧩 Product data is managed through a separate `products.js` file
- 🖼️ Product image, name, and price are shown clearly
- 🎨 Simple and clean UI using HTML & CSS
- 💻 Fully frontend-based; no login or backend
